# Clear-air

## according to the incubator, the task was set more pragmatic and realistic, to get a percentage result on the accuracy of our sample with the machines with the highest number of points awarded by the algorithm. We processed about 70-80 thousand cars, and received 380 particularly dangerous pollutants, the accuracy was 80%, according to the eco police of Almaty. The task is more analytical than engineering, even taking into account this factor, we touched on data engineering when uploading and uploading data. Everything was supervised by a mentor. Mentor - CTA of Sergek, Bulat Tangirbergen. In general, it is a very interesting task and the solution we chose optimally took into account all the factors that are mandatory when evaluating environmental data. We used quadratic and linear gas propagation and accounting for the lane along which the car was moving. Technically, they used numpy, plotly, pandas, PyTorch - they only touched someone else's code in order to understand how the camera evaluates data about the car and enters it into the database. We dealt with matstat, linear algebra for CV. I hope I have described everything succinctly, if you have any questions, I will be happy to answer. Whether we have lowered the level of pollution is not for us to judge, but for the Department of Ecology, according to their resume we were able to at least detect the largest pollutants, but there are legal nuances there.
